# Zerodha Ops Task

## Description

This repo contains solutions to the tasks defined in `README-task.md` file.


### Pre-requisites

In order to run the solutions mentioned in this repo, one must have the following applications installed:
- Go
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Vagrant
- Virtual Box
- Ansible
- Kubernetes
- Nomad


### Setting up the app.

In order to proceed with the solutions, first you'll need to compile the Go binary of the application.
- ```cd docker```
- ```make build```

This is a Go application which connects to Redis. The app increments a Redis `counter` (key `demo:requests`) on an incoming request at path `/`. It also requires two environment variables:
- `DEMO_APP_ADDR` default set as `:8080`, exposes the app at this port.
- `DEMO_REDIS_ADDR`, connects to redis (eg: `redis:6379`).

## Tasks

### - Create a `Dockerfile` for the app.

The solution to this task is defined in the `docker` folder of this repository

```
cd docker
```

#### Dockerfile Explanation.
- We begin our Dockerfile with the (optional) parser directive line used by BuildKit for file interpretation (version of syntax). We then tell Docker what base image we would like to use for our application, here we are using official Go image that already has all necessary tools and libraries to compile and run a Go application.
  ```
  # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

  FROM golang:1.13
  ```
- We then set a Working Directory inside the image that we are building, this also instructs docker to set this as the default destination for all subsequent commands.
  ```
  WORKDIR /app
  ```
- Before we install the modules necessary to compile the Go application, we need to copy `go.mod` and `go.sum` files. After Copying the required files we run `go mod download`.
  ```
  COPY go.mod go.sum ./
  RUN go mod download
  ```
- The next thing we need to do is to copy our source code into the image.
  ```
  COPY main.go ./
  ```
- Next, we declare the Environment variables that will be used by our application
  ```
  ENV DEMO_APP_ADDR 8080
  ENV DEMO_REDIS_ADDR redis:6379
  ```
- Now, we would like to compile our application. This will output a binary called `zerodha-demo-app`.
  ```
  RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o /zerodha-demo-app -ldflags="-X 'main.version=${VERSION}'"
  ```
- We also expose the port that our Go application will listen to
  ```
  EXPOSE ${DEMO_APP_ADDR}
  ```
- Now, all that is left to do is to tell Docker what command to execute when our image is used to start a container. Here we execute our Go binary.
  ```
  CMD ["/zerodha-demo-app"]
  ```

#### Build the image.

Now that we've created our Dockerfile, letâ€™s build an image from it.

```
docker build -t zerodha-demo-app:latest .
```

Docker image `zerodha-demo-app` with tag `latest` is created

### - Create a `docker-compose.yml` for the app.

The solution to this task is defined in the `docker` folder of this repository

```
cd docker
```

#### `docker-compose.yaml` explanation.

We've created a `docker-compose.yaml` file with 3 services:
- Redis
  ```
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    container_name: redis
    volumes:
      - ./redis:/data
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
  ```
  - Uses the latest Official Redis image
  - Defines the conatiner name as `redis`.
  - Mounts the local `redis` directory to `data` directory inside the container, this is used to persist data.
  - Forwards port `6379` of host to port `6379` of container.

- App
  ```
  app:
    image: zerodha-demo-app:latest
    container_name: app
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - DEMO_APP_ADDR=:8080
      - DEMO_REDIS_ADDR=redis:6379
    depends_on:
      - redis
  ```
  - Uses the image `zerodha-demo-app` with `latest` tag, local image will be used if you've executed the `docker build` command as detailed above.
  - Defines the container name as `app`.
  - Forwards port `8080` of host to port `8080` of container.
  - Uses two Environment Variables:
    - `DEMO_APP_ADDR` with default value as `:8080`.
    - `DEMO_REDIS_ADDR` with default value as `redis:6379`.
  - Declares the dependency on `redis` service, this service won't be created before `redis` service is created.
- Nginx
  ```
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/nginx-conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d
      - ./nginx/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl
  ```
  - Uses the latest Official Nginx image.
  - Defines the container name as `nginx`.
  - Forwards port `80` of host to port `80` of container and port `443` of host to port `443` of container.
  - Mounts two volumes:
    - `nginx/nginx-conf` of local to `/etc/nginx/conf.d` of container. This contains `default.conf` that will be used by nginx to set the configuration. The configuration listes to port `80`, port `443` and `localhost` and proxies the request to `http://app:8080/` which is the `app` service defined above. The nginx config also has ssl certificates defined for `zerodhademoapp.com` domain (example domain) which was generated using openssl.
      ```
      openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -subj "/C=CA/ST=QC/O=Company, Inc./CN=zerodhademoapp.com" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:zerodhademoapp.com" -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout zerodha-demo-app.key -out zerodha-demo-app.crt;
      ```
    - `nginx/ssl` of local to `/etc/nginx/ssl` of container. This fodler contains the ssl certificate and key generated by the `openssl` command mentioned above.


#### Run `docker.compose.yaml`.

```
docker compose up
```
Or to run it in detached mode (background)
```
docker compose up -d
```
Since we have the image built locally, we can also add `--pull never` to force docker compose to use local images.

Now to check if the application is running properly, go to your browser and enter the url `https://localhost` or `http://localhost`, you should get a page like
```
welcome to api. key count is: 1
```

### Write a bash script to set up a Vagrant box with Ubuntu.

The solution to this task is defined in the `vagrant/bash-scripts` folder of this repository
```
cd vagrant/bash-scripts
```

#### Install Brew, Vagrant and Virtual Box

- Install Homebrew if not already installed.
  ```
  if ! command -v brew &>/dev/null; then
    echo "Homebrew is not installed. Installing..."
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
  else
    echo "Homebrew is already installed."
  fi
  ```
  We check if brew is already installed by `command -v brew` and piping the output to `/dev/null` where the output is ignored by the shell. If there was no output, we install homebrew.

- Install Vagrant if not already installed.
  ```
  if ! command -v vagrant &>/dev/null; then
    echo "Vagrant is not installed. Installing..."
    brew install --cask vagrant
  else
    echo "Vagrant is already installed."
  fi
  ```
  Using the same logic as above we check if vagrant is installed by running `command -v vagrant` and if there's no output, we install vagrant using brew.

- Install Virtual Box is not already installed.
  ```
  if ! command -v VirtualBox &>/dev/null; then
    echo "VirtualBox is not installed. Installing..."
    brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
    brew install virtualbox-beta
  else
    echo "VirtualBox is already installed."
  fi
  ```
  Check if VirtualBox is installed, if not we install VirtualBox using brew.
  **Note:** I'm running M1 Mac (ARM64) laptop which does not support stable Virtualbox, hence using a beta version. If you're not on a ARM64 machine, you can use `brew install virtualbox`.

Run The script using bash
```
chmod +x install_vagrant.sh
bash install_vagrant.sh
```

#### Create a vagrant project and provision it using ansible.
- `create_vagrant_project.sh` file sets up the Vagrant project:
  - Check if vagrant is already installed, else exit
    ```
    if ! command -v vagrant &>/dev/null; then
      echo "Vagrant is not installed. Please run the install_vagrant.sh script to install Vagrant first."
      exit 1
    fi
    ```
  - Check if virtualbox is already installed, else exit
    ```
    if ! command -v VBoxManage &>/dev/null; then
      echo "VirtualBox is not installed. Please install VirtualBox before setting up the VM."
      exit 1
    fi
    ```
  - Change directory for your Vagrant project where `Vagrantfile` is defined
    ```
    cd ..
    ```
  - Start the VM with Vagrant
    ```
    vagrant up
    ```
  - Configure the VM (runs the ansible playbook `playbook.yml` as configured in the `Vagrantfile`)
    ```
    vagrant provision
    ```
- `Vagrantfile` starts a VM box and runs ansible playbook `playbook.yml` to configure the VM
  - Start VM box with ubuntu 18 image
    ```
    config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"
    ```
  - Enable Ansible provisioning, uses local ansible setup (`ansible_local`) and runs `playbook.yml` file.
    ```
    config.vm.provision "ansible_local" do |ansible|
      ansible.playbook = "playbook.yml"
    end
    ```
- `playbook.yml` used for configuring the VM
  - Setup hostname of VM as `demo-ops`.
    ```
    - name: Set the hostname to demo-ops
      hostname:
        name: demo-ops
      become: true
    ```
  - Create a user `demo`, also added it to sudoers group.
    ```
    - name: Creating user demo with sudo access
      user:
        name: demo
        password: "{{ 'super_secret_password' | password_hash('sha512', 'superstrongsalt') }}"
        groups: sudo
    ```
    We use `password_hash` to provide hashed password to ansible and use salt to maintain the consistency of the hash.

  - Disable root login
    ```
    - name: Disable Root Login
      lineinfile:
            dest: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
            regexp: '^PermitRootLogin'
            line: "PermitRootLogin no"
            state: present
            backup: yes
      notify: Restart SSH
    ```
    We are using `ansible.builtin.lineinfile` module, this checks the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file for a line that starts with `PermitRootLogin` and replaces it with `PermitRootLogin no`, if the regexp is not present, it appends the line at the end of the file. This also sends a notification to `Restart SSH` handler which restarts the sshd service.

  - Setup a basic firewall (e.g., UFW) allowing only specific ports.
    ```
     - name: Install ufw
      apt: package=ufw state=present

    - name: Configure ufw defaults
      ufw: direction={{ item.direction }} policy={{ item.policy }}
      with_items:
        - { direction: 'incoming', policy: 'deny' }
        - { direction: 'outgoing', policy: 'allow' }
      notify:
        - restart ufw

    - name: Configure ufw rules
      ufw: rule={{ item.rule }} port={{ item.port }} proto={{ item.proto }}
      with_items:
        - { rule: 'allow', port: '22', proto: 'tcp' }
        - { rule: 'allow', port: '80', proto: 'tcp' }
        - { rule: 'allow', port: '443', proto: 'tcp' }
      notify:
        - restart ufw

    - name: Enable ufw
      ufw: state=enabled
    ```
    - Install ufw.
    - Set default as `deny` for all `incoming` and `allow` for all `outgoing`.
    - Allow incoming on port `22`, `80`, and `443`.
  - Configure `sysctl` for sane defaults. (For eg: increasing open files limit)
    ```
    - name: Set sysctl parameters
      sysctl:
        name: "{{ item.name }}"
        value: "{{ item.value }}"
        sysctl_set: yes
        state: present
        reload: yes
      loop:
        - { name: "fs.file-max", value: 65535 }
        - { name: "net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies", value: 1 }
        - { name: "vm.swappiness", value: 10 }
    ```
    - `fs.file-max`: sets the maximum number of file-handles that the Linux kernel will allocate. This value is tuned to improve the number of open files, (256 for 4 MB of RAM). We are setting to 65535 for ~2GB of RAM.
    - `net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies`: when enabled it sends out syncookies when the syn backlog queue of a socket overflows. This is to prevent against the common â€˜SYN flood attackâ€™.
    - `vm.swappiness`: It controls the relative weight given to swapping out of runtime memory, as opposed to dropping memory pages from the system page cache. The lower the value, the less swapping is used and the more memory pages are kept in physical memory. We are reducing it to 10 to allow redis to use more physical memory.
  - Set the system's timezone to "Asia/Kolkata"
    ```
    - name: Set system timezone
      timezone:
        name: Asia/Kolkata
    ```
  - Install Docker and Docker-Compose.

        dest: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
        mode: 'u+x,g+x'
    ```
  - Configure Docker Daemon to have sane defaults. For eg: keep logs size in check.
    ```
    - name: Configure Docker Daemon
      copy:
        src: docker-daemon.json
        dest: /etc/docker/daemon.json
      notify: Restart Docker
    ```
    - Sets the `log-driver` as `json-file`.
    - sets `max-size` (max size of log files) of logs to `20m`.
    - sets `max-file` (max number of log files) to 5.
  - Deploy the `docker-compose.yml` in `/etc/demo-ops` and start the services.
    ```
    - name: Create a directory if it does not exist
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /etc/demo-ops
        state: directory
        mode: '0755'

    - name: copy Docker Compose files
      copy:

      become: true

    - name: deploy Docker Compose stack
      community.docker.docker_compose:
        project_src: /etc/demo-ops
    ```
    - Creates a directory `/etc/demo-ops`.
    - Copy the docker compose files, uses a special ansible var `playbook_dir` which is the directory where the playbook is present.
    - Starts the `docker-compose.yaml` present in `/etc/demo-ops` directory.
  - At the end of the main playbook, it imports 4 other playbooks:

### Nomad

The solution to this task is defined in the `nomad` folder of this repository
```
cd nomad
```

#### Start a dev agent

```
nomad agent -dev -bind 0.0.0.0 -network-interface='{{ GetDefaultInterfaces | attr "name" }}'
```

#### Create a namespace

Nomad has support for namespaces, which allow jobs and their associated objects to be segmented from each other and other users of the cluster.
```
nomad namespace apply -description "Namespace for deploying demo app" demo-ops
```

#### Nomad Job spec

The `demo-app.nomad.hcl` Job spec does the following:
- Creates a job called `zerodha-demo-app`.
- Sets the datacentre as `dc1`.
- Sets the namespace as `demo-ops`.
- Sets he type of job as `service`.
- Creates a group called `cache` for redis.
  - `network` block defines a port `db` (`6379`) and `to` to configure port to map to tasks's network. (mode=`bridge` does not wokr on mac)
  - `service` block registers a service to named `app-redis` which uses port `db` and specifies the provider as `nomad`.
  - `task` block creates an individual unit of work called `redis`
    - Uses `docker` driver
    - Config block defines the image (`redis:latest`) and ports (`db`) used.
  - `resources` block specifies the min resource requirement (256 cpu and memory)
- Creates a group called `demo-app` for our Go app.
  - `network` block defines a port `http` (`8080`) and `to` to configure port to map to tasks's network.
  - `service` block registers a service to named `app-http` which uses port `http` and specifies the provider as `nomad`.
  - `task` block creates an individual unit of work called `app`
    - Uses `docker` driver
    - Config block defines the image (`zerodha-demo-app:local`) (Note: using `local` tag to pull the image from local, if not already created, tag the already existing `zerodha-demo-app:latest` by running the command `docker tag zerodha-demo-app:latest zerodha-demo-app:local`) and ports (`db`) used.
  - `template` block takes the `data` and renders it to the destination `secrets/db.env`. The `env` specifies that the template is to be read as an env var for the task. The `change_mode` specifies that the task will be restarted if the data is changed.
  - `resources` block specifies the min resource requirement (500 cpu and 256 memory)
- Creates a group called `nginx` for Nginx.
  - `network` block defines a port `http` (`80` and `443`) and `to` to configure port to map to tasks's network.
  - `service` blocks registers two services to named `nginx-http` and `nginx-https` which uses port `http` and `https` respectively, and specifies the provider as `nomad`.
  - `task` block creates an individual unit of work called `nginx`
    - Uses `docker` driver
    - Config block defines the image (`nginx:latest`) and ports (`http` and `https`) used.
    - Mount block binds the source file to a destination on the container. Here we are mounting `default.conf`, `zerodha-demo-app.crt` and `zerodha-demo-app.key`.
  - `template` block takes the `data` (in this case, a file on host) and renders it to the destination on nomad local. The `change_mode` specifies that the task will be restarted if the data is changed.
  - `resources` block specifies the min resource requirement (500 cpu and 256 memory)
